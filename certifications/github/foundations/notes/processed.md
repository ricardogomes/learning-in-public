# GitHub Foundations Certification Study

These are my processed notes. The [notes file](./index.md) are the study capture I did while taking the learning path courses.

I organized these notes based on the domains in the [github-foundations-exam-study-guide](study guide), with the addicion of the Domain 0, that just gets the point of view of the products. The notes on Domain 0 will probably be a part of the other domains, but I feel I need a single place to put this more static data.

## Domain 0 - GitHub Product Offerings

For Individuals:
- GitHub Free
- GitHub Pro
For Organizations:
- GitHub Free for Organizations
- GitHub Team
For Entreprises:
- GitHub Enterprise Cloud
- GitHub Enterprise Server

Both individuals and organizations can have unlimited public repositories, packages and projects, but on the Free versions private repositories are limited. Support is community based on Free plans and via email on Paid plans.

Enterprise accounts manage multiple Organizations, offers adicional security, SAML SSO. Server is the self hosted option and GitHub Connect allows for some features of GitHub.com such as Depedabot.

GitHub Actions, Packages and Codespaces (only provides free tier on personal accounts) are the features that have quatitative diferences between plans:

|      			   | Free  | Pro    | Free Org | Team  | Enterprise Cloud |
| ------------------------ | ----  | ---    | -------- | ----  | ---------------- |
| Actions    minutes/month | 2.000 | 3.000  | 2. 000   | 3.000 | 50.000		  |
| Packages   storage/month | 500MB | 2GB    | 500MB    | 2GB   | 50GB		  |
| Codespaces   hours/month | 120   | 180    | N.A.     | N.A   | N.A		  |
| Codespaces storage/month | 15GB  | 20GB   | N.A.     | N.A   | N.A		  |

Organizations can opt-in to assume the costs of Codespaces but don't have montly free resources.

As GitHub Enterprise Server is the odd one out, being the ony self hosted option, here are some notes on it's deployment:

We can deploy GHES on hypervisors:
  - Microsoft Hyper-V
  - OpenStack KMV
  - VMware ESXi

Or on public clouds:
  - AWS
  - GCP
  - Azure

Some features are optional:
- GitHub Actions
- GitHub Connect
- GitHub Advanced Security
- GitHub Packages

This should be a fair summary of the GitHub's product line.
