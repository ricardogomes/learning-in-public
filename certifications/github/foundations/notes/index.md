### 1 - Introduction to git and Introduction to GitHub

- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uGS1ak_FGg%3Fazure-portal%3Dtrue)
- [Introduction to Git](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/intro-to-git/?ns-enrollment-type=Collection&ns-enrollment-id=o1njfe825p602p)
- [Introduction to GitHub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-to-github/?ns-enrollment-type=Collection&ns-enrollment-id=o1njfe825p602p)
- I apparently didn't understand the moce to another module and I did both :-)

```bash
# Simple Commands

git --version

git config user.name "Ricardo Gomes" # --global for global config
git config user.email "<email>"

git init

git status
# displays the state of the working tree

git add
# tell git to start keepting track of certain files

git add "<path>"
# git add -A adds all files that are not modifications

git commit
# save staged changes to snapshot

git commit -m "<Commit message>" # optional <file|path>: git commit file -m ""
# -a paramenter for git commit stages all changes

git commit --amend --no-edit

git log
# see informations about previous commits

git log --oneline

git checkout -- "<file>" # checkout a single file (maybe after a unintended rm)

git rm "<file>"

git reset HEAD index.html

git checkout -b "<new branch name>"

```

- A .gitignore file allows file/folder exclusion.
- A .git-keep file forces tracking of the folder its in even if its empty
- Examples of VCSs:
    - CVS
    - Subversion - SVN
    - Perforce
    - Mercurial - Hg
- Git is a distributed VCS
- GitHub Desktop is a GUI for git
- GitHub is a platform that uses git as its core technology
- Key features provided by GitHub:
    - Issues
    - Discussions
    - Pull Requests
    - Notifications
    - Labels
    - Actions
    - Forks
    - Projects
- GitHub provides an AI-Powered platform to build, scale and deliver secure software
- Core pillars of GitHub Entreprise:
    - AI: Copilot
    - Collaboration: Repositories, Issues, Pull Requests
    - Productivity: CI/CD
    - Security
    - Scale
- Gists are similar to repositories for storing and sharing code snippets
- Gists can be public or secret. Secret does not mean private, we can share the link with anyone they are however not searchable
- GitHub repositorys and have a Wiki to store documentation
- State of a file:
    - untracked: not a part of the git repo
    - tracked: actively monitored by git:
        - unmodified: no changes since last commit
        - modified: changes since last commit
        - staged: modified and part of the staging area (index) and ready to be commited
        - commited: file is in the repo's database, and represents the latests version
- PRs can have one or more reviewers
- PR reviewers and comment, add changes or use the PR for further discussion
- GitHub Flow is a lightweight workflow that allows for safe experimentation, the main steps are:
    1. Create a branch
    2. Implement changes and deploy / test implementation
    3. Create Pull Request - ask collaborators for feedback
    4. Review and Implement Feedback
    5. Approve Pull Request and merge it into main
    6. Delete branch
- We can create Issues from:
    - a repository
    - a item in a task list
    - a note in a project
    - a comment in an issue or pull request
    - a specific line of code
    - a URL query
- Discussions need to be enabled on the repository
- All Discussions must be created in a category
- Default Discussion categories:
    - üì£ Announcements
    - #Ô∏è‚É£ General
    - üí° Ideas
    - üó≥Ô∏è Polls
    - üôè Q&A
    - üôå Show and tell
- We can receive ongoing updates about a specific activity on GitHub via Subscription
- Notifications are updates we receive for specific activities we are subscribed to
- We can subscribe to notifications from:
    - A conversation in a specific issue, pull request or gist
    - All activity in a repository
    - CI activity
    - Repository issues, pull request, releases, security alerts, or discussions
- 

#### Concepts

- **Version Control System**: (VCS), also called **Software Configuration Management** (SCM) tracks changes to a collection of files
- **Distributed VCS**: both client and server store a project's complete history, client can work offline and sync later
- **Working Tree**: set of diretories and files that store the version of the project we're working on
- **Repository**: diretory (top level of a working tree) where git keeps all the history
- **Bare Repository**: repository without the working tree
- **Hash**: result of a hash function. In git hashes are use to represent objects (files, folders, commits). Git uses 160 bit hashes
- **Object**: git has 4 types of objects, identified by SHA-1 hash:
    - blob object contains a file
    - tree object represents a directory. Contains names, hashes and permissions
    - commit object represents a specific version fo the working tree
    - tag object is a name attached to a commit
- **Branch**: named series of linked commits
- **HEAD**: the most recent commit of the current branch
- **Remote**: named reference to another git repository, the default named origi
- **Commands, Subcommands and Options**: in `git reset --hard`, git is the command, reset the subcommand and --hard the option
- **Commit**: a change to one or more files, it's assigned a unique ID, the time and contributor
- **Pull Request**: mechanism used to signal that commit(s) from one branch are ready to be merged into another branch
- **Issues**: used to track ideas, feedback, tasks, or bugs
- **Discussions**: used to ask an answer questions, share information, make announcements, or have conversations about a project
- **Subscription**: 
- **Notification**: 
- **GitHub Pages**: used to publicize and host a website me, my organization or project


#### Questions from platform
Questions for later review

- What is the best way to report a bug to a GitHub project? 
    1. Send an email to a project owner.
    2. I don't bother reporting software bugs because there's no transparency and they never get fixed anyway.
    3. **Search for the bug in the project's existing issues and create a new one if it hasn't been reported yet.**
- Suppose you created a bug fix on a new branch and want it to become part of the next production build generated from the main branch. What should you do next? 
    1. Copy your branch changes and commit them directly to the main branch.
    2. **Create a pull request to merge your new branch into the main branch.**
    3. On second thought, maybe I won't share this fix. I'll just put it in my own private version of the source code.
- Suppose you'd like to work with a project on GitHub, but you don't have write access to the project. What can you do to contribute? 
    1. **Fork the project's repository to your GitHub account, clone the forked repository to your local machine, push changes to your repository, and submit a pull request to the target (upstream) repository.**
    2. Clone the project to your local machine and push updates directly to the project repository.
    3. Use git commands to make a copy of the project so that you can work locally. Submit an issue to get your changes into the target repository.
- Which of the following scenarios is a common use case for a version control system? 
    1. Deleting earlier versions of a project or file, so you know you are working only with the most current file or data.
    2. **Making experimental changes to your project in an isolated branch.**
    3. Gathering feature requirements for a large project and communicating them to stakeholders.
- What is another name for a version control system? 
    1. Version management software (VMS)
    2. Software control management (SCM) system
    3. **Software configuration management (SCM) system**
- What‚Äôs the difference between Git and GitHub? 
    1. **Git lets you work with one or more local branches and push changes to a remote repository. GitHub acts as the remote repository, which is accessed through a website or command-line tools.**
    2. Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that runs in the cloud. GitHub is an interface layer that provides access to Git technology.
    3. Git is used by an individual contributor. GitHub is used by multiple contributors to simplify group development work.
- What Git command gives information about how to use Git? 
    1. git init
    2. git status
    3. **git help**

### 5 - Code with GitHub Codespaces
- GitHub Codespaces is a fully configured development environment hosted in the cloud
- GitHub Codespaces lifecycle:
    - Creating a Codespace
        - Can be done in GitHub.com, VSCode or GitHub CLI
        - From a GitHub template or any tempalte repository on GitHub.com to start a new project
        - From a branch in a repository
        - From an open pull request
        - From a commit in the commit history
        - When creating:
            - VM and storage are assigned to the Codespace
            - A container is created
            - A connection to the Codespace is made
            - A post-creation setup is made
    - Rebuilding a Codespace
        - images from cache are used to speed up
        - can perform full rebuid to clear cache
        - changes outside /workspace are cleared
        - changes inside /workspace are preserved
    - Stopping a Codespace
    - Deleting a Codespace
        - inactive codespaces for 30 days are deleted (configurable)
- Differences between GitHub.dev and GitHub Codespaces:
    - no associated compute on github.dev
    - no terminal on github.dev
    - only subset of extensions on github.dev
    - can start on github.dev and move to codespaces
- When using new Codespaces each time we should push regularly
- When using long-running Codespaces we should pull each time we start working
- Repo admins can enable Codespaces prebuilds for a repository to speed up Codespace creation
- When conneting to Codespace via VSCode we must enable auto save
- 30 minutes of inactivity timeout stops the Codespace (configurable)
- A stopped Codespace only incurs storage costs
- Customization
    - Settings Sync
    - dotfiles: can use dotfiles repository
    - rename auto-generated name
    - change shell
    - change machine type
    - set up default editor:
        - VSCode Desktop
        - VSCode Web
        - JetBrains Gateway
        - JupyterLab
    - set default region
    - set stop timeout
    - set auto deletion
    - add extensions or plugins (VSCode Desktop or Web | Jetbrains Marketplace)
- can configure development container per repository
    - docker containers configured for the project
#### Questions
- Which directory is the clone placed after creating a Codespace? 
    - **/workspaces directory**
    - /temp directory
    - ~/.bashrc directory
    - Linux directory
- What's the maximum number of Codespaces that you can create per repository or branch? 
    - You can only create two Codespaces.
    - You can create a total of ten Codespaces.
    - You can create a total of thirty Codespaces.
    - **You can create an unlimited number of Codespaces per repository or branch, depending upon available space. When you reach an upper amount of resources, a message displays that an existing Codespace needs to removed/deleted before a new Codespace can be created.**
- What happens when Codespace loses internet connectivity? 
    - **If the connection to the internet is lost while working in a Codespace, you aren't able to access your Codespace.**
    - Codespace doesn't require an internet connection. I can access my Codespace regardless if I lose connectivity.
    - If you lose internet connection while working on your Codespace, your changes aren't saved.
- What defines the beginning of a Codespace's lifecycle? 
    - **A Codespace's lifecycle begins when you create a Codespace and ends when you delete it.**
    - A Codespace's lifecycle begins immediately when GitHub is opened and ends when the software is closed.
    - A Codespace's lifecycle begins when a repository is created and ends when it's deleted.

   - **Hello, *world*!**
   - X  ***Hello, world!***
   - ### Hello, world!
- How do you print certain characters, like asterisks (*) and underscores (_), literally on your output? 
  - Use three in a row, like \*\*\* or ___.
  - **Escape them with a backslash, like \* or \_.**  **
  - Unfortunately, this isn't supported at this time.
- Suppose there's an HTML snippet that you want to include on your GitHub Pages web site, but Markdown doesn't offer a way to render it. What should you do? 
  - **Just add the HTML inline.**
  - Cut the content. If it's not supported in Markdown, then it's probably not worth including.
