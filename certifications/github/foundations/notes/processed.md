# GitHub Foundations Certification Study

These are my processed notes. The [./notes.md](notes file) are the study capture I did while taking the learning path courses.

I organized these notes based on the domains in the [github-foundations-exam-study-guide](study guide), with the addicion of the Domain 0, that just gets the point of view of the products. The notes on Domain 0 will probably be a part of the other domains, but I feel I need a single place to put this more static data.

## Domain 0 - GitHub Product Offerings

For Individuals:
- GitHub Free
- GitHub Pro
For Organizations:
- GitHub Free for Organizations
- GitHub Team
For Entreprises:
- GitHub Enterprise Cloud
- GitHub Enterprise Server

Both individuals and organizations can have unlimited public repositories, packages and projects, but on the Free versions private repositories are limited. Support is community based on Free plans and via email on Paid plans.

Enterprise accounts manage multiple Organizations.

GitHub Actions, Packages and Codespaces (only makes sense on personal accounts) are the features that have quatitative diferences between plans:

|      			 | Free  | Pro 	  | Free Org    | Team 	       | Enterprise |
| ---------------------- | ----	 | ---	  | --------	| ----	       | ---------  |
| Actions min/month	 | 2.000 | 3.000  | 2. 000      | 3.000	       | 50.000	    |
| Packages Storage/month | 500MB | 2GB	  | 500MB	| 2GB 	       | 50GB	    |
| Codespaces hours/month | 120	 | 180	  | N.A.	| N.A	       | N.A	    |
| Codespaces stora/month | 15GB	 | 20GB	  | N.A.	| N.A	       | N.A	    |
