My Learning in Public journey

The purpose of this repo is to store all my learning in public efforts, this will include things like:

- Practice Platforms like [Exercism](https://exercism.org/profiles/ricardogomes), [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/ricardogomes)
- Certification studying, via courses or self learning
- Concept organization: not sure of the definition yet, but my goal is to organize and map large concepts with practical components (like mathematics and it's applications)
